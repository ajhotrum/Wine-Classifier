CS 7641 Machine Learning
Project 1

Program files were taken and slightly modified from the code in this repository:
https://github.com/cmaron/CS-7641-assignments/tree/master/assignment1

Zipped program files can be found at:

In order to run the program from the "assignment1" directory, simply type "python run_experiment.py --all" into the commmand prompt.

The software requirements for running the program are:
	numpy == 1.15.1
	scipy == 1.1.0
	scikit-learn == 0.19.2
	pandas == 0.23.4
	xlrd == 0.9.0
	matplotlib == 2.2.3
	seaborn == 0.9.0
	scikit-optimize == 0.5.2
	gym == 0.10.5


NOTE: The ANN module will not work if not all software requirements are met.
